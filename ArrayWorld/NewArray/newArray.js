// newArray is just an another approach for playing around with JS Arrays

// creating an array
let brands = new Array(2); // what does it do? => basically creates an empty array with n items but with length n
console.log(brands);
console.log(brands[0]); // fuck you!!
console.log(brands.length); // screw it!!!
