/**
 * The above example is a synchronous callback, as it is executed immediately.
 * Note, however, that callbacks are often used to continue code execution after an asynchronous operation has completed â€” these are called asynchronous callbacks.
 * A good example is the callback functions executed inside a .then() block chained onto the end of a promise after that promise fulfills or rejects.
 * This structure is used in many modern web APIs, such as fetch().
